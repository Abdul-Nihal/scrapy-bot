ISIS-DRC, also known as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and Madina at Tauheed Wau Mujahedeen, among other names, has unleashed brutal violence against Congolese citizens and regional military forces across North Kivu and Ituri Provinces in Eastern DRC. The group killed more than 849 civilians in 2020 alone, according to the UN Security Council.In March 2021, the Department of State designated Baluku as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).

Additionally, it is a crime to knowingly provide material support or resources to ISIS-DRC or to attempt or conspire to do so.The ADF was previously sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the United Nations under the UN Security Council\u2019s DRC sanctions regime in 2014 for its violence and atrocities. The U.S. Department of the Treasury also sanctioned Baluku and five other ADF members in 2019 under the Global Magnitsky sanctions program for their roles in serious human rights abuse. In 2020, the UN designated Baluku for additional sanctions under its DRC sanctions program.",

In al-Hawl \u2014 with some 70,000 people, the largest of these displaced persons camps in northeast Syria \u2014 ISIS supporters have received up to $20,000 per month via hawala, an informal transfer mechanism; the majority of those financial transfers have originated outside Syria or passed through neighboring countries such as Turkey.Illicit oil operations and trafficking in looted archaeological objects from Syria and Iraq also have been key sources of revenue that generate hard currency and enable ISIS to carry out its brutal tactics and oppress innocent civilians. ISIS\u2019s damage to and looting of cultural and historical sites in Syria and Iraq have destroyed irreplaceable evidence of ancient life and society.Ancient and historical coins, jewelry, carved gemstones, sculptures, plaques, and cuneiform tablets are among the types of cultural objects that ISIS has trafficked. With support from the U.S. Department of State, the International Council of Museums developed the Emergency Red Lists of Cultural Objects at Risk to present the categories of cultural objects looted and trafficked from Syria and Iraq.

Its newest sources of funding include extortion of elders, businesspeople, and farmers; exploitation of the used automobile trade to its benefit; mobile money transfers, and theft of pastoralists\u2019 livestock. Through territorial expansion, al-Shabaab also engages in illicit activities, such as illegal mining and trade/smuggling of commodities such as charcoal, heroin (which it resells to criminal groups), ivory, livestock, and sugar. Al-Shabaab also imposes taxes on individuals, businesses, pirates, etc., and collects tolls, fees, and taxes on agricultural produce and land.The Department of State is offering rewards for information leading to the identification and disruption of:\u2013 significant sources of revenue for al-Shabaab (e.g., extortion and taxation, smuggling of contraband, and weapons and drug trade)\u2013 exploitation of local natural resources by al-Shabaab (e.g., logging, mining, and smuggling)\u2013 financial contributions by donors and financial facilitators to al-Shabaab\u2013 significant transactions by financial institutions and use of money service providers to transfer funds and access the international financial system on al-Shabaab\u2019s behalf\u2013 businesses or investments owned or controlled by al-Shabaab or its financiers\u2013 international activity by front companies tied to al-Shabaab, engaged in financial transactions on its behalf (e.g., used vehicle trade)\u2013 criminal schemes involving al-Shabaab members and supporters, who are financially benefiting the organization (e.g., kidnapping-for-ransom operations and theft of pastoralists\u2019 livestock)\u2013 illicit financial schemes of al-Shabaab (e.g., money laundering), and transfers of funding and material by al-Shabaab to its terrorist and militia proxies and partnersOn March 18, 2008, the U.S. Department of State designated al-Shabaab as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended.
